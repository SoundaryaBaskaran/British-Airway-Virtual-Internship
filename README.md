# British Airways Good or Bad?
This project is a part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage with British Airways.

## The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks
1. Web scraping to gain company insights
2. Predicting customer buying behaviour

### Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights
Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for Britis Airways was collected from [Skytrax](Skytrax).


Following insights were uncovered as they are summed up in the one slide presentation.
